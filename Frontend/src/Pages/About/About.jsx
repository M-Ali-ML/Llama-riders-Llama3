            <h4>About This Project</h4>
            <p>
              The Job Application Assistant is an AI-powered tool designed to
              streamline job applications by generating personalized responses
              and cover letters. Using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
              framework with a LLaMA 3 model, it integrates information from
              applicants' LinkedIn profiles and resumes to provide tailored
              answers to common job application questions and craft customized
              cover letters. The system extracts key details from the
              applicantâ€™s documents, generates context-aware responses, and
              ensures consistency and quality across applications. This tool
              saves time, increases personalization, and enhances the overall
              efficiency of the job application process.
